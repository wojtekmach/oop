# OOP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/oop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/oop)

Are you tired of all of that modules, processes and functions nonsense? Do you want to just use classes, objects and methods? If so, use OOP [1] library in Elixir [2]!

## Demo

[![Lightning Talks - Wojtek Mach (ElixirConfEU 2016)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/5EtV2JUU0Z4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EtV2JUU0Z4)

## Example

```elixir
import OOP

class Person do
  var :name

  def say_hello_to(who) do
    what = "Hello #{who.name}"
    IO.puts("#{this.name}: #{what}")
  end
end

joe = Person.new(name: "Joe")
mike = Person.new(name: "Mike")
robert = Person.new(name: "Robert")

joe.say_hello_to(mike)    # Joe: Hello Mike
mike.say_hello_to(joe)    # Mike: Hello Joe
mike.say_hello_to(robert) # Mike: Hello Robert
robert.say_hello_to(mike) # Robert: Hello Mike

joe.set_name("Hipster Joe")
joe.name # => Hipster Joe
```

An OOP library wouldn't be complete without inheritance:

```elixir
class Animal do
  var :name
end

class Dog < Animal do
  var :breed
end

snuffles = Dog.new(name: "Snuffles", breed: "Shih Tzu")
snuffles.name # => "Snuffles"
snuffles.breed # => "Shih Tzu"
```

... or multiple inheritance:

```elixir
class Human do
  var :name
end

class Horse do
  var :horseshoes_on?
end

class Centaur < [Human, Horse] do
end

john = Centaur.new(name: "John", horseshoes_on?: true)
john.name # => "John"
john.horseshoes_on? # => true
```

See more usage in the [test suite](test/oop_test.exs).

## Installation

Add `oop` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:oop, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

[1] According to Alan Kay, the inventor of OOP, "objects" is the lesser idea; the big idea is "messaging". In that sense, I can't agree more with Joe Armstrong's quote that Erlang is "possibly the only object-oriented language".

[2] Please don't. You've been warned.
